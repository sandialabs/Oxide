Oxide is a flexible, modular, distributed framework for performing analysis of 
executable code. It separates the user interface components from the storage 
components and from the analysis components. The system is designed such that a 
module writer who is a domain expert in the specific area of the module does not
need much knowledge of the rest of the system. The same modules work no matter 
how or where the data is stored or what sort of interface the user is seeing.
